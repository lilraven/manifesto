        <p>It’s about the struggle between
individuals with jagged passion in
their work and today’s faceless
corporate committees, which claim to
understand the needs of the mass
audience, and are removing the
idiosyncrasies, polishing the jags,
creating a thought-free, passion-free,
cultural mush that will not be hated
nor loved by anyone. By now, virtually
all media, architecture, product and
graphic design have been freed from
ideas, individual passion, and have
been relegated to a role of corporate
servitude, carrying out corporate
strategies and in creasing stock prices.
Creative people are now working for
the bottom line. Magazine editors
have lost their editorial independence,
and work for committees of publishers
(who work for committees of advertis
ers). TV scripts are vetted by produc-
ers, advertisers, lawyers, research
specialists, layers and layers of paid
executives who determine whether
the scripts are dumb enough to amuse
what they call the “lowest common
denominator” Film studios out films in
front of focus groups to determine
whether an ending will please target
audiences. All cars look the same.
Architectural decisions are made by
accountants. Ads are stupid. Theater is
dead. Corporations have become the
sole arbiters of cultural ideas and
taste in America. Our culture is
corporate culture.Culture used to be
the opposite of commerce, not a fast
track to “content”- derived riches. Not
so long ago captains of industry (no
angels in the way they acquired
wealth) thought that part of their
responsibility was to use their millions
to support culture. Carnegie built
libraries, Rockefeller built art muse-
ums, Ford created his global founda-
tion. What do we now get from our
billionaires? Gates? Or Eisner? Or
Redstone? Sales pitches. Junk mail.
Meanwhile, creative people have their
work reduced to “content” or
“intellectual property” Magazines and
films become “delivery systems” for
product messages. But to be fair, the
above is only 99 percent true. I offer a
modest solution: Find the cracks in the
wall. There are a very few lunatic
entrepreneurs who will understand
that culture and design are not about
fatter wallets, but about creating a
future. They will understand that
wealth is means, not an end.
Under other circumstances they may
have turned out to be like you,
creative lunatics. Believe me, they’re
there and when you find them, treat
them well and use their money to
change the world.</p>
